## Our Foundation is Taking Shape

What an incredible few weeks it's been! Since our official registration with Badger Region Volleyball, we've witnessed amazing momentum as our founding team comes together. Today, we want to share an update on our progress and what's ahead as we continue building something extraordinary.

### Foundation Team Progress

We're thrilled with the caliber of athletes who have joined our program. The character, skill, and commitment of our founding members reflect exactly what we envisioned when we started this journey. These young women understand what it means to build each other up and pursue excellence together.

**Current Focus:**
While we continue to finalize our complete roster, we're actively working with interested families to ensure the right fit for both our program and prospective athletes. We believe in taking the time to build relationships and make thoughtful decisions that benefit everyone involved.

### What Sets Our Approach Apart

**Relationship-First Philosophy**
We're not just filling roster spots—we're building a family. Every conversation with prospective athletes and their families is an opportunity to ensure alignment with our values and vision. We believe this careful approach creates a stronger foundation for long-term success.

**Excellence Through Encouragement**
Our founding athletes are already demonstrating what we knew was possible: that high-level competition and genuine encouragement aren't opposing forces. They're learning to challenge each other to be better while providing unwavering support, especially during difficult moments.

**Family Partnership**
We're seeing firsthand how our family-centered approach strengthens rather than strains relationships. Parents are becoming partners in their daughters' development, and we're building a community that extends far beyond the volleyball court.

### Training Environment Update

**Facility Partnership Confirmed**
Our partnership with Elm Grove Lutheran Church continues to develop beautifully. The training environment provides everything our athletes need to grow and excel, and we're grateful for their support of our mission.

**Coaching Excellence**
Our coaching staff is fully committed to developing both volleyball skills and character in our athletes. Every practice, every interaction, and every decision is guided by our commitment to empowerment, excellence, teamwork, family, and integrity.

### Looking Ahead: Season Preparation

**August Focus Areas:**
- Continued roster finalization with remaining interested families
- Team building and culture establishment among our founding athletes
- Skills assessment and individual development planning
- Parent partnership meetings and program orientation

**September Preparation:**
- Official practice schedule implementation
- Tournament preparation and competitive readiness
- Community building events and family integration
- Character development programming launch

### Our Commitment to Transparency

We believe in honest, clear communication with our families. As we continue building our program, we'll keep you informed about:
- Roster development and team formation progress
- Training schedules and competitive opportunities
- Program costs and payment options
- Family events and community building activities

**We're committed to ensuring every family has the information they need to make confident decisions about their involvement with Empower Volleyball Club.**

### For Families Still Considering

If your daughter is interested in joining our foundation team and plays outside hitter or middle hitter, we encourage you to reach out. We're looking for athletes who:
- Demonstrate both skill and character
- Understand the importance of building teammates up
- Are excited about being part of something meaningful from the beginning
- Share our commitment to excellence and integrity

### A Message from Our Leadership

Every day, we see more clearly why we started this journey. Our founding athletes are proving that young women can be both competitive and encouraging, both excellent and humble, both strong and supportive. They're becoming the leaders we hoped they would be.

To the families who have already joined us: thank you for your trust and partnership. To those still considering: we're here to answer questions and help you determine if Empower Volleyball Club is the right fit for your family.
