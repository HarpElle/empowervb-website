## Transparency in Action: Your Club Update

We believe in keeping our future families informed every step of the way. As we work toward our official launch, we want to share the exciting progress we're making behind the scenes. Building a championship program takes careful planning, and we're committed to doing it right—with integrity and excellence guiding every decision.

### Current Progress Updates

**Facility Partnership Development**
We're finalizing our partnership details with Elm Grove Lutheran Church, which will serve as our primary training facility. This partnership represents more than just a location—it's a collaboration with a community-minded organization that shares our values of family, integrity, and supporting young people in their growth.

**Coaching Staff Recruitment**
Our search for passionate, experienced leaders is underway! We're seeking coaches who not only bring technical expertise but also align with our core values of Empowerment, Excellence, Teamwork, Family, and Integrity. We want coaches who understand that developing character is just as important as developing skills, and who believe in building each other up through every challenge.

**Administrative Excellence**
We're working through all required documentation and completing our Badger Region volleyball registration process. This ensures we meet all competitive volleyball standards and can provide our athletes with the highest level of competitive opportunities.

**Community Response**
The pre-registration interest and community response has been incredibly encouraging! We're hearing from families who are excited about our vision and approach, and it's motivating us to continue building something truly special.

### What This Means for You

Every detail we're working on now directly impacts your daughter's future experience with Empower VB. From the quality of our facilities to the caliber of our coaching staff, from our competitive registration to our community partnerships—we're building a foundation that will serve our athletes for years to come.

We're not just creating a volleyball program; we're establishing a place where young athletes can discover their potential, develop their character, and experience the power of teamwork in an environment that celebrates both individual growth and collective success.

### On Track for Success

We remain confidently on track for our **August 1st official launch date**! This milestone will mark the beginning of our official operational phase, when we can share:
- Complete tryout information and registration details
- Final coaching staff introductions
- Detailed program timeline and costs
- Training schedules and competition plans

### Our Promise to You

As we continue this journey, we promise to maintain this level of transparency and communication. Your trust is important to us, and we want you to feel confident in choosing Empower VB as your volleyball home. We're building something that will empower your daughter to excel not just in volleyball, but in life.

**Stay tuned for more updates as we approach our August 1st launch!** The best is yet to come.
