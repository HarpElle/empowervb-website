## A New Chapter Begins in Wisconsin Volleyball

We’re thrilled to introduce **Empower Volleyball Club** to the Southeastern Wisconsin volleyball community! After months of passionate planning and preparation, we’re ready to share our vision with families who believe in the transformative power of volleyball.

### Our Mission: Excellence Through Empowerment

Empower Volleyball Club isn’t just another volleyball club—we’re a family-centered program dedicated to empowering female athletes through exceptional training, unwavering encouragement, and a commitment to excellence both on and off the court. We believe in building champions who excel not only in competition but in character, confidence, and community leadership.

Our approach combines elite volleyball training with a supportive family environment where players develop both their athletic skills and personal character. Every practice, every game, and every interaction is designed to foster growth, build resilience, and create lasting bonds through the power of teamwork and integrity.

### Coming Soon: U15 Nationals Team

We’re currently forming our inaugural **U15 Nationals team** for the 2025-26 season. This is your daughter’s opportunity to be part of something special from day one—to help establish the culture, traditions, and standards that will define Empower Volleyball Club for years to come.

Official tryout information will be announced in August 2025 following our Badger Region affiliation. We’re committed to transparency throughout this process and will share detailed information about dates, locations, and requirements as soon as they’re available.

### Be Part of Our Foundation Story

Join our interest list to be the first to know when tryouts are announced, and follow us for updates on our journey to building a championship program! As a founding member family, you’ll have the unique opportunity to shape our club culture from the ground up.

### Our Heart: Building Each Other Up

> *"encourage each other and build each other up" - 1 Thessalonians 5:11*

This verse captures the heart of who we are. In volleyball, there are moments when we feel out of rhythm—when mistakes pile up and confidence takes a hit. It’s in these moments that encouragement from our teammates matters most. We want to create a culture where support, positivity, and grace are as vital as skill and strategy. When we lean into encouragement and lift one another up, we strengthen our team and reflect the unity we’re called to live out.

**Ready to learn more?** We can’t wait to meet you and share more about the Empower Volleyball Club family!
