## Welcome to Empower Volleyball Club!

We're excited to announce the launch of Empower Volleyball Club, a new 
competitive volleyball program dedicated to empowering female athletes 
through excellence, teamwork, and character development.

### Our Mission
Empower VB combines elite volleyball training with a supportive family 
environment where players can develop both their athletic skills and 
personal character. We believe in building champions on and off the court.

### Coming Soon: U15 Nationals Team
We're currently forming our inaugural U15 Nationals team for the 2025-26 
season. Official tryout information will be announced in August 2025 
following our Badger Region affiliation.

### Stay Connected
