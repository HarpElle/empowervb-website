## Productive Tryouts and Roster Progress!

We're pleased to report that our **August 17th tryouts were productive and positive!** The athletes who participated showcased their skills, attitude, and commitment to excellence. The energy and sportsmanship displayed truly embodied our core values of Empowerment, Excellence, Teamwork, Family, and Integrity.

**We're excited to announce that we've made solid progress on our roster** and are well on our way to building an exceptional U15 Nationals team for the 2025-2026 season.

## Still Seeking Outside & Middle Hitters

While we've made significant progress in building our team, **we're still actively seeking two talented hitters** to complete our roster:

- **1 Outside Hitter** - Dynamic attacking presence with strong passing skills
- **1 Middle Hitter** - Quick, athletic player for fast-tempo offense and blocking

We're looking for athletes who not only possess exceptional volleyball skills but also demonstrate the character, work ethic, and team-first mentality that aligns with our club's mission to empower female athletes through excellence and family.

## WIAA Season and Our Players

The **Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association (WIAA) high school volleyball season is now underway**, and we want to extend our heartfelt wishes to all the athletes from our tryouts as they compete for spots on their high school teams and prepare for their upcoming seasons. 

This is an incredible opportunity for continued growth and development, and we encourage all athletes to give their best effort, support their teammates, and represent their schools with pride. **We look forward to reconnecting with you and watching your continued development throughout the fall season.**

## Second Chance Tryouts: November Opportunities

For athletes who are still interested in joining our U15 Nationals team, **we want you to stay alert for "Second Chance Tryouts" announcements from Badger Region Volleyball**. These opportunities typically occur in the **second half of November** and provide another pathway for talented players to showcase their abilities.

### Important Timeline Information

**Please note**: Due to WIAA regulations and our commitment to fair play, **we are not permitted to conduct any tryouts or make team offers until November 15, 2025 at the earliest**. This ensures all athletes can focus on their high school seasons without conflict.
