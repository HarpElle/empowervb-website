On this Independence Day, we're thrilled to officially introduce Empower Volleyball Club to the Southeastern Wisconsin volleyball community! After months of planning, preparation, and passion-driven work, we're ready to share our vision with families who believe in the power of volleyball to transform young athletes.

Empower VB is more than just a new clubâ€”we're a family-centered program dedicated to empowering female athletes through exceptional training, unwavering encouragement, and a commitment to excellence both on and off the court. Our mission is simple yet powerful: to foster confidence, build character, and create an environment where every athlete can thrive.

As we prepare to launch our inaugural U15 team this fall, we invite you to be part of something special from the very beginning. Stay tuned for tryout announcements coming August 1st!
